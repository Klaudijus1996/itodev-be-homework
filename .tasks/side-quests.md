- Transactional API middleware so make sure that in case of error, the database is not left in an inconsistent state.
- DB lock on registration or at least unique constraint on event_registration_event_id_email at the database level to prevent double registrations.
- API documentation. Attempted to do something using `api-platform` libraries, but takes some time.
- Ez sorting and filtering by query params on the API endpoints.
- `AvailableEventsController` may be more suited as is required by the task definition, but I would like it to be just a simple filter passed by url instead.
- Add a test env setup to make file or figure out how to define testing env & create a test db properly. Had some failed attempts at it.
- Tests, at least feature based tests for the API & it's surroundings like error handling & transactions.
- Static analysis tools
- Code formatting tools
